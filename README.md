# StonecuttersDAO
Built as a part of the buildspace create a DAO project in late December 2021. Shoutout to Farza.

Stonecutters DAO is for Web3 programmers to cooperatively crowdfund their labor to efficiently and accurately finish Web3 projects.
You can mint an ERC1155 NFT to gain access to the DAO, and any member can vote on proposals.
There are 42000000 STONED tokens that will be airdropped to members of the DAO as they complete contracts.
Want to think of this almost like a Web3 questing guild, where party members of different talents can party up and share the rewards of building the Web3 ecosystem.
